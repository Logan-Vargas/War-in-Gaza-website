<h1>Gaza death toll passes 25,000</h1>
<p>The death toll in Gaza has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-01-21-24/h_0ed5ce16dff974f59e66908023fd08c1">surpassed 25,000 people</a>  since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. The Palestinian toll includes <b>25,105 killed and 62,681 injured</b> , according to the ministry. <i> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/">CNN</a> cannot independently verify the  numbers due to the challenges of reporting from the war zone</i>. The Israel Defense Forces said Sunday that military activities in the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Gaza-Strip">Gaza Strip</a>  were continuing, with “dozens of terrorists eliminated and large quantities of weapons located.” According to an operational update, IDF snipers in cooperation with the Israeli Air Force (IAF) “eliminated a number of terrorists” in Khan Younis in the south of Gaza while troops also “eliminated 15 terrorists” in Daraj Tuffah in the northern part of the territory. In an update Sunday morning, the IDF said one additional soldier had been killed in combat, bringing Israel's military death toll to 195 since Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza began.</p> <img src="https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/18/57/80/1200x675_cmsv2_916f3cdc-d7ef-505a-90dd-ba36b3113f7a-8185780.jpg" alt="1200" width="675"/>

<h2>Latest Israeli election poll spells more bad news for Netanyahu</h2>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister <b>Benjamin Netanyahu</b>’s political prospects in <b>Israel</b>  continue to look dim, with a new poll suggesting that his party would come in a very distant second if elections were held today, and the coalition he leads now would not win enough seats to stay in power. <b>Benny Gantz</b>, a former defense minister who joined Netanyahu’s war cabinet from the opposition after the October 7 attacks, would be the biggest winner, the poll for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/">CNN</a> affiliate Channel 13 suggests. His National Unity party would win 37 seats, the poll projects. Netanyahu’s Likud party would win 16 with him at the helm, and former Prime Minister Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid party would come in third with 14, projections suggest. <i>A slim majority (53%)</i> said Netanyahu’s personal interests were the main consideration driving his conduct of the war. <i>A third (33%)</i>  said the national interest was his main consideration, with the remaining respondents saying they did not know or not answering the question. Israelis last went to the polls on November 1, 2022. The next elections are scheduled for October 27, 2026, but many Israelis expect a national election to be called this year. The polling, conducted and released Sunday by leading Israeli pollster Camil Fuchs for <a href="https://13tv.co.il/">Channel 13</a>, is broadly in line with other polls conducted since the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=October+7+Hamas+attack+on+Israel&rlz=1C1GCEB_enUS1089US1089&oq=October+7+Hamas+attack+on+Israel&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBBzY1NWowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&safe=active&ssui=on">October 7 Hamas attack on Israel</a> .</p> <img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240109075450-netanyahu-010724.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill" alt="1480" width="833">
